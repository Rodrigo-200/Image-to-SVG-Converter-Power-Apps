# Border Removal Fix - Testing Guide

## What Was Fixed

The border removal feature was not actually cropping the downloaded SVG files. While the frontend correctly detected borders (showing orange highlighting), the backend was using Sharp's basic `trim()` method which only removes white backgrounds.

### Changes Made

1. **Frontend Enhancement**: 
   - Modified `useImageConversion.js` to detect borders using sophisticated pixel analysis (brightness threshold 220)
   - Pass precise border coordinates to backend via `borderData` parameter

2. **Backend Enhancement**:
   - Updated both `server.js` and `api/convert-to-svg.js` to use Sharp's `extract()` method
   - Uses precise pixel coordinates from frontend for exact cropping
   - Falls back to basic `trim()` if border data parsing fails

3. **Version Update**: Bumped to v1.3.3

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev:full
```

### 2. Test with Sample Images
Create test images with obvious borders/whitespace:
- White borders around colored content
- Screenshots with desktop backgrounds
- Images with excessive padding

### 3. Testing Steps
1. **Upload an image** with visible white/light borders
2. **Enable "Remove Borders"** toggle in settings
3. **Check Live Preview**: Should show orange highlighting around detected borders
4. **Click "Convert to SVG"** (requires backend connection)
5. **Download the SVG** and verify:
   - The downloaded SVG should be cropped to remove the detected borders
   - Content should fill the entire SVG viewport
   - No whitespace/borders should remain

### 4. Verification Points
- ‚úÖ **Orange highlighting appears** in preview when borders detected
- ‚úÖ **Console shows border detection logs** with precise coordinates
- ‚úÖ **Backend receives borderData** parameter
- ‚úÖ **Sharp extract() method used** for precise cropping
- ‚úÖ **Downloaded SVG is actually cropped** (main fix)
- ‚úÖ **SVG works properly in Power Apps** controls

### 5. Console Logging
Look for these log messages:
```
üîç Detecting borders for precise removal...
üîç Border data for backend: {originalWidth, originalHeight, borders, contentArea}
üîç Using precise border data: {...}
‚úÇÔ∏è Extracting area: {left, top, width, height}
‚úÖ Precise border removal applied using frontend detection
```

## Expected Behavior

**Before Fix**: 
- Orange highlighting showed borders correctly
- Downloaded SVG contained full image with borders
- Users had to manually crop SVGs for Power Apps

**After Fix**:
- Orange highlighting still shows borders correctly
- Downloaded SVG is precisely cropped to content area
- SVGs ready for Power Apps without manual editing

## Fallback Behavior

If borderData fails to parse or is unavailable:
- Falls back to Sharp's basic `trim()` method
- Logs warning message about fallback
- Still provides some border removal capability

## Technical Details

### Frontend Border Detection
- Uses canvas pixel analysis with brightness threshold 220
- Detects top, bottom, left, right borders in pixels
- Calculates precise content area coordinates
- Passes data to backend as JSON

### Backend Processing
- Parses frontend border data
- Uses Sharp's `extract({left, top, width, height})` method
- Provides pixel-perfect cropping
- Maintains image quality during processing

### Sharp Extract vs Trim
- **extract()**: Precise pixel-level cropping using coordinates
- **trim()**: Basic edge detection limited to solid colors
- Our solution combines frontend intelligence with backend precision
